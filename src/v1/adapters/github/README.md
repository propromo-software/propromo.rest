# Propromos Github Adapter for the needed Github Graphql-API-Endpoints

Some endpoints of the Github-API can only be accessed via the Graphql-API.  
This adapter provides a simple way to access the endpoints that the Propromo-App needs via rest.  
It is basically a wrapper around the Github Graphql-API, to reduce it's complexity and to make it easier to use.
